# Contributing

I kindly ask anyone who wants to contribute to this project to follow some basic guidelines:

1. Open a discussion around the change before contributing any code

   https://github.com/sventorben/keycloak-home-idp-discovery/discussions/categories/ideas)
2. Create a GitHub Issue with a good description associated with the PR
4. One feature/change per PR
5. One commit per PR 
6. PR rebased on main (`git rebase`, not `git pull`) 
7. Good descriptive [conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), with link to issue
8. No changes to code not directly related to your PR
9. Includes basic tests

   Please do not add additional test frameworks without prior consultation
10. Include some documentation/extend the README
